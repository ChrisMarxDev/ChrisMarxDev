# Hi there! 👋 I'm Christopher Marx

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 😄 I'm a **freelancer** specializing in **Flutter** and **Dart**, building sleek apps and smart backends. 🧑‍💻

### A little about me

🌍 Based in **Hamburg**, Germany, where I enjoy the cozy blend of tech vibes and maritime charm. <br>
🛠️ Passionate about **exploring different technologies**—always on the lookout for something new to learn or build! <br>
✨ Absolutely *fond* of **Dart**—it's my go-to for everything, from mobile apps to crafting **backend magic**. <br>
🎉 Outside of code, I enjoy a good mix of running 🏃, surfing 🏄, board games 🎲, cooking and eating 🍳.
