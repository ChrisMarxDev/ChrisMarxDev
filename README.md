### A little about me:
🌍 Based in **Hamburg**, Germany, where I enjoy the cozy blend of tech vibes and maritime charm. <br>
🛠️ Passionate about **exploring different technologies**—always on the lookout for something new to learn or build! <br>
✨ Absolutely *fond* of **Dart**—it's my go-to for everything, from mobile apps to crafting **backend magic**. <br>
🎲 Outside of code, I’m a board game enthusiast who loves a good round of engine-building games.
